# tapad.js-testing

Pre-requisites: 
NPM and Node (instructions below also include NVM, the preferred way to manage your node installation)
1. `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash`
2. `nvm install node`

Running the script:
1. `cd path/to/this/directory`
2. `npm install`
3. `node ./index.js`

The script as configured here will log timing information about the relevant network requests to the console

If you would like more information, it will be available in the `tracing.json` file generated by the script.

Google Chrome provides a good GUI for navigating this json file: simply go to `chrome://tracing` and drag-and-drop the json file to explore.

The script provides a simple example of how to interact with the content of the json file in a programmatic way.
